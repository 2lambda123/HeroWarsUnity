The problem with global undo:
   It's unclear when you've fully committed to something



What do I get from move undo?
   The ability to view the consequences of your terminal actions by previewing even ones that require a move to use
   What if the infopanel gave you a preview even when a move is out of range? That wat you could always check.
   Now all actions are terminal and can only be used once per turn.

   The second thing you get from undo is a safety net for accidental move inputs.
   Unclear whether this is necessary.






- if stationary ability
   cannot be used after moving

? do abilities have to be used immediately after move/attacking


Ability Use Types
